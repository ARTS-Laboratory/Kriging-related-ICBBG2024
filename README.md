# Kriging-related-ICBBG2024
This folder containes code, data, plots for 1D kriging for different soil compositions and for 2D plot for voltage vs Time (to show specific time stamps (TS))

* data: This folder has raw data named "Three Experiments used_To Mechanical_V2". Here are also three post processed data for analysis as like.
  *compact_sand_final.csv
  *0.5% XG Biopolymers_final.csv
  *10% Silt_final.csv
   
* plots: This folder saves all plots after run code.
* plot_2D_5spike_data.py (this code is used for 2D plot during voltage vs Time (also to show specific time stamps (TS))
* kriging_1D_compactedsand.py (this is 1D kriging code for compacted sand soil composition)
* kriging_1D_Biopolymers.py (this is 1D kriging code for 0.5 % XG Biopolymers soil composition)
* kriging_1D_Slit.py (this is 1D kriging code for 10 % Slit soil composition)
